    <h3 class="h3Padded">Why InkWizard?</h3>
<p>InkWizard is an app that I made based on my personal experiences. I grew up loving reading and would
often write my own short stories. As I got older and started writing longer and more complex stories I
began having trouble keeping up with all the little details and my stories declined in quality. I realized if I had a program to help me take notes and keep track of information my writing process would go
much smoother. InkWizard was my solution.
